# Build apps in 10x speed ðŸš¢

Hey builder ðŸ‘‹
I made this template to allow you to build apps in 10x speed. It's a template that I use for my own projects and I'm sharing it with you. It has a lot of features that I use in my projects and I hope you will find it useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me on Twitter.

## Features

- [x] [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - ReactJS framework that allows you to create full-stack apps
- [X] [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) - Build framework to export your JavaScript app to native apps
- [X] [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework for inline-styles (design system)
- [X] [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - Tailwind CSS components (I use this for my projects)
- [X] [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) - Best analytics tool for developers (Better than GA and Mixpanel because it's so easy to use)
- [] [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Management library for databases (adding this soon)
- [] ... more to come
